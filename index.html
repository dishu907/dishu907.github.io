            <h2>Agent-Based Modelling to Understand Neighborhood Effects on Democratization</h2>
            <p>I modeled neighborhood effects on autocratic states to assess whether the regime preferences of bordering states can be influenced to discourage democratic backsliding in highly autocratic regions. 
                Using the Mesa library, I mapped the parameters of the proposed theoretical model to appropriate initialization and assumption functions, enabling accurate simulation of autocratic evolution within 
                a political neighborhood based on shifts in state preferences. I then outlined an analytical paper that explores potential solutions for democratizing repressive states by running variations of the 
                simulation, highlighting the emergent phenomenon of regime coalitions and networks that may arise from deterrence signaling to neighboring states.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h2> Markov Chain Simulation for Political Terror Measurement</h2>
            <p>I developed a Markov chain model to predict the distribution of Political Terror Scale (PTS) scores for states from 1976 to 2021. By modifying the existing PTS dataset, I constructed nested for-loops 
                to calculate empirical transition probabilities for each state space of the chain, enabling the prediction of the proportion of states across each of the five PTS scores over more than 50 time intervals. 
                Using eigendecomposition and the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, I calculated the equilibrium distribution of PTS scores for the next 50-100 years and created an animated graph to visualize the distribution 
                dynamics over time. I then analyzed the data and compiled a report highlighting the correlation between the level of political terror and the duration of human rights repression spells, recommending the 
                further use of urn models and improved categorization to enhance predictability.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h2> Regression Modelling to Predict State Respect for Human Rights </h2>
            <p>I cleaned the CIRIGHTS dataset on states' human rights records, extracting three key explanatory variables related to physical integrity rights, civil liberties, and repression, to assess the binary 
                accuracy of predicting states' respect levels for human rights. Using logistic regression with the StatsModels and Sklearn libraries, I split the data into training and test sets to build the model, 
                then evaluated the predictive accuracy of the variables through a confusion matrix and accuracy scores. I formulated a report with the predictive analysis results, demonstrating an 89% model prediction 
                accuracy, and provided a detailed explanation of how precision, recall, and F1 scores capture distinct measures of model performance regarding true and false positives/negatives. I also recommended 
                incorporating variables related to labor rights to enhance the predictability of human rights outcomes.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h2> Sentiment Analysis Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, I employed sentiment analysis techniques involving tokenization and polarity on Reddit data to better understand American public opinion on the genocide in Gaza. Specifically, I selected a 
                relevant Reddit post, pre-processed the text, and applied TextBlob for sentiment analysis. The sentiment scores were surprisingly neutral on average, with most comments being objective despite the divisive 
                nature of the conflict. Positive comments were more common than negative ones, and the analysis revealed a tendency towards objective reporting rather than subjective opinions, possibly due to a focus on military 
                updates rather than the humanitarian aspects of the conflict.</p>

            <h2> Geospatial Analysis Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, I employed geospatial techniques to produce visual maps of Detroit that contain information on crime frequency information for various neighborhoods. Shapefiles consisting of zip code, neighborhood, 
                and crime data were used to create maps of Detroit based on both neighborhood and zip code boundaries, and determine which areas had the highest and lowest numbers of crime incidents in 2021. Comparing the zip code and 
                neighborhood maps of Detroit, it is evident that the northwest region of the city seemed to have a larger number of crime incidents on both maps, while the safer regions appear to be in the 48207 zip code and neighborhood 
                region and the southern tip of the city.</p>
