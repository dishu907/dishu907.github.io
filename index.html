        <p>Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:</p>

        <!-- Agent-Based Model Project Section -->
        <section class="project">
            <h2>Agent-Based Model Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created an agent-based model to simulate regime shifts in political neighborhoods. The project includes Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the model's development and a PDF report with the analysis and results.</p>
            
            <h3>Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/dishu907/dishu907.github.io/blob/main/Agent-Based-Model/ABM_Version_1.ipynb" target="_blank">Model 1 (Notebook 1)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/dishu907/dishu907.github.io/blob/main/Agent-Based-Model/ABM_Version_2.ipynb" target="_blank">Model 2 (Notebook 2)</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project Report</h3>

        <section class="project">
            <h2> Markov Chain Simulation Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created an Markov chain to simulate the long-term stationary distribution of states' Political Terror Scale scores. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the model's development and a PDF report with the analysis and results.</p>
